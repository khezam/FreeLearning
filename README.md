# FreeLearning
FreeLearning is a free educational forum for those who want to learn programming.

The goal of FreeLearning is to provide free education for everyone in the world live 24 hours without any cost. FreeLearning is also for those who truly and deeply want to help
others. 

When I started teaching myself programming, I faced so many difficulties to the point where I did not know what I did not know. I was trying so hard to be able to 
write simple code but I was not able to shape my thoughs to write simple code. Luckily, I met a friend at a meetup who had gone through the same experince and who
put me on the right path to start learning data-structure and algorithm. So, I religiously started learning data-structures and alogrithm by reeding FREE books 
online that I found.

After that, I started teaching myself C language, HTTP, networking, Postgresql, Ruby, Javascript, git, HTML, and Flask for FREE. So, the essance of FreeLearning is
to teach people for FREE.

There are features that could be added to FreeLearning for example, the design, private messages and etc. Please feel free to add anything 
to FreeLearning to make things better.

By the way, I'm still learning everyday and I love doing this.

Cheers
